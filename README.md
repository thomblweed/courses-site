✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Setup

This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. To install dependencies, run `pnpm install`.

## Start the application

Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `pnpx nx build courses-site` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
pnpx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
pnpx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
pnpx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `pnpx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
